| **Summary**               | As a property manager or service owner, I want to create, modify, and delete logically isolated network configurations on operator-managed network access devices (such as gateways or mesh Wi-Fi), so that I can securely segment networks for tenants, guests, or IoT devices, ensuring privacy and easy reconfiguration. |
| **Roles, Actors and Scope** | **Roles:** customer:user <br> **Actors:** Service owners, property managers, IoT integrators, network operators.  <br> **Scope:**  Order to Activate (O2A) - Create isolated networks with Wi-Fi access details (SSID, security mode, password). Configure which devices host these networks. Modify or delete existing networks as tenancy or use cases change. |
| **Pre-conditions**        | 1. The API consumer is onboarded with the API provider and has received access credentials with proper scopes (e.g., `isolated-networks:write` and `devices:write`).  <br>2. The service owner has one or more operator-managed devices installed at the premises.  <br>3. The network operator has implemented the NAM API with support for isolated network configuration. |
| **Begins when**      | The API client makes a `POST` request to `/isolated-networks` to create a new isolated network (with optional expiration), providing access details (SSID, security mode).
| **Ends when** |   The network configuration is created, updated, or removed and reflected on targeted devices. |
| **Post-conditions**       | - New isolated networks are configured on specified devices, logically segmenting LAN traffic.  <br>- Obsolete networks are removed from devices and automatically deleted if no longer assigned. |
| **Exceptions**            | - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters (e.g., malformed SSID, unsupported security mode).  <br>- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or expired access token.  <br>- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient scope or revoked client authorization.  <br>- `404 Not Found`: Nonexistent network or device ID. |
